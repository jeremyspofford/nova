# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What Is Nova

Nova is a self-directed autonomous AI platform. Users define a goal; Nova breaks it into subtasks, executes them through a coordinated agent pipeline, and re-plans as needed. It runs as a 9-service Docker Compose stack.

## Architecture

**Services and ports:**

- **orchestrator** (8000) — Agent lifecycle, task queue, pipeline execution, MCP tool dispatch, DB migrations (FastAPI + asyncpg)
- **llm-gateway** (8001) — Multi-provider model routing via LiteLLM: Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, Groq, Gemini, Cerebras, OpenRouter, GitHub, Claude/ChatGPT subscription providers (FastAPI)
- **memory-service** (8002) — Embedding + hybrid semantic/keyword retrieval via pgvector (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy async)
- **chat-api** (8080) — WebSocket streaming bridge for external clients (FastAPI)
- **chat-bridge** (8090) — Multi-platform chat integration: Telegram, Slack (FastAPI + httpx + redis). Optional, start with `--profile bridges`.
- **dashboard** (3000/5173) — React admin UI (Vite dev / nginx prod)
- **postgres** (5432) — pgvector-enabled PostgreSQL 16 (data bind-mounted to `./data/postgres/`)
- **recovery** (8888) — Backup/restore, factory reset, service management (FastAPI + asyncpg + Docker SDK). Only depends on postgres — stays alive when other services crash.
- **cortex** (8100) — Autonomous brain: thinking loop, goals, drives, budget tracking (FastAPI + asyncpg)
- **intel-worker** (8110) — AI ecosystem feed poller: RSS, Reddit JSON, page change detection, GitHub trending/releases. Pushes content via orchestrator HTTP API, queues to engram ingestion (FastAPI, health-only server)
- **knowledge-worker** (8120) — Autonomous personal knowledge crawler: LLM-guided web crawling, GitHub API extraction, encrypted credential storage (FastAPI). Optional, start with `--profile knowledge`.
- **voice-service** (8130) — STT/TTS provider proxy: OpenAI Whisper, OpenAI TTS, Deepgram, ElevenLabs (FastAPI). Optional, start with `--profile voice`.
- **screenpipe-bridge** (8140) — Subscribes to a user-installed [screenpipe](https://screenpi.pe/) daemon (workstation-side) over WebSocket (HTTP polling fallback), aggregates raw events into 30-min-capped focus sessions, applies a two-layer privacy denylist, pushes payloads to engram ingestion queue (FastAPI + websockets + httpx + redis). Optional, requires user-installed screenpipe daemon.
- **redis** (6379) — State, task queue (BRPOP), rate limiting, session memory (data bind-mounted to `./data/redis/`)

**Inter-service communication:** All HTTP. Orchestrator calls llm-gateway (`/complete`, `/stream`, `/embed`) and memory-service (`/api/v1/engrams/*`). Dashboard proxies to orchestrator (`/api`), llm-gateway (`/v1`), recovery (`/recovery-api`), cortex (`/cortex-api`), and voice-service (`/voice-api`). Chat-api forwards to orchestrator's streaming endpoint. Chat-bridge calls orchestrator (`/api/v1/tasks/stream`) to relay messages from external platforms. Cortex calls orchestrator (task dispatch, goal management), llm-gateway (planning, evaluation), and memory-service (read/write knowledge). Intel-worker calls orchestrator (`/api/v1/intel/feeds`, `/api/v1/intel/content`, `/api/v1/intel/feeds/{id}/status`) and pushes to Redis queues (db0 engram ingestion, db6 intel new-items). Knowledge-worker calls orchestrator (`/api/v1/knowledge/sources`, `/api/v1/knowledge/crawl-log`), llm-gateway (`/complete` for relevance scoring), and pushes to Redis queues (db0 engram ingestion, db8 knowledge state). Screenpipe-bridge subscribes to a user-installed screenpipe daemon over the network (WS primary, /search poll fallback) and pushes focus-session payloads to the engram ingestion queue (Redis db0). Reads runtime config from Redis db1. Dashboard depends only on recovery at startup — shows a startup screen while other services come online.

**Shared contracts:** `nova-contracts/` is a Pydantic-only package defining the API contract between services (chat, llm, memory, orchestrator models). Any service satisfying these models is a drop-in replacement.

**Quartet Pipeline:** 5-stage agent chain — Context → Task → Guardrail → Code Review → Decision. Runs via Redis BRPOP task queue with heartbeat (30s) and stale reaper (150s timeout). Pipeline code lives in `orchestrator/app/pipeline/`.

**Redis DB allocation:** orchestrator=db2, llm-gateway=db1, chat-api=db3, memory-service=db0, chat-bridge=db4, cortex=db5, intel-worker=db6, recovery=db7, knowledge-worker=db8, voice-service=db9, screenpipe-bridge=db10.

## Build & Run Commands

```bash
# First-time install (interactive wizard: mode selection, .env, GPU detect,
# model pulls, services up). Renamed from ./setup → ./install on 2026-04-28.
./install

# Production boot-up after install (idempotent: build + up + wait for health)
./start

# Remove Nova from this machine (preview-first, then 'type uninstall' to confirm)
./uninstall

# Dev with hot reload
make dev          # or: docker compose up --build --watch
make watch        # sync Python source into running containers
make logs         # tail all container logs
make ps           # container status

# Production
make build        # rebuild all images
make up           # start detached
make down         # stop all

# GPU overlays (auto-detected by setup.sh)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up -d   # NVIDIA
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.rocm.yml up -d  # AMD ROCm

# Backup / Restore (emergency CLI — normally use the Recovery UI at /recovery)
make backup               # create a database backup to ./backups/
make restore              # list available backups
make restore F=<file>     # restore a specific backup

# Cleanup (NEVER run raw docker system prune — use these instead)
make prune                # remove containers, images, build cache (preserves ALL volumes)
make prune-all            # backup DB first, then prune + remove model cache volumes
```

**Dashboard dev server:** Runs on port 5173 via Vite with proxy to backend services. Production uses nginx on port 3000.

**DB migrations:** Run automatically at orchestrator startup from `orchestrator/app/migrations/*.sql`. No Alembic — pure versioned SQL files run idempotently.

## Testing

```bash
make test          # Full integration suite (35 tests, ~2 min, requires services running)
make test-quick    # Health endpoints only (~0.4s)
```

Integration tests live in `tests/` at the repo root. They hit real running services over HTTP/WebSocket — no mocks. Pipeline tests are opt-in (skipped unless an LLM provider is configured). Tests create resources with `nova-test-` prefix and clean up via fixture teardown.

Additional validation:

- Dashboard: `cd dashboard && npm run build` (TypeScript compilation check)
- Each FastAPI service: `/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints
- Interactive: chat-api serves a test UI at `http://localhost:8080/`
- API docs: FastAPI auto-docs at `/docs` on each service

## Code Conventions

**Python (all backend services):**

- Async/await throughout (FastAPI + asyncpg + async Redis)
- Config via `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings` reading from `.env`
- Orchestrator uses raw asyncpg queries (no ORM); memory-service uses SQLAlchemy async
- Fault-tolerant: try/except + `logger.warning` — never crash on missing optional config
- **Log levels matter:** ERROR for unrecoverable failures, WARNING for recoverable issues that affect functionality, INFO for state changes, DEBUG for detailed flow. Never log critical failures at DEBUG — they become invisible in production (LOG_LEVEL=INFO).
- **Redis cleanup:** Every service with `get_redis()` must have a corresponding `close_redis()` called in the FastAPI lifespan shutdown path. Connection leaks accumulate across restarts.
- Snake_case everywhere; JSONB for flexible fields; UUID primary keys; TIMESTAMPTZ

**React/TypeScript (dashboard):**

- Functional components only, TanStack Query for server state (staleTime=5s, retry=1)
- Tailwind CSS with stone/teal/amber/emerald palette; Lucide React icons
- API calls via `apiFetch<T>()` in `src/api.ts`; admin secret stored in localStorage

**API design:**

- Raw JSON responses (no `{ data: ... }` wrapper)
- Admin auth: `X-Admin-Secret` header
- API key auth: `Authorization: Bearer sk-nova-<hash>` or `X-API-Key`
- Streaming: SSE with JSON lines

## Engram Memory System

The old 4-tier memory (working/episodic/semantic/procedural) has been replaced by the **Engram Network** — a graph-based cognitive memory system. Code lives in `memory-service/app/engram/`.

**Key components:**

- **Ingestion** (`ingestion.py`) — Async Redis queue worker decomposes raw text into structured engrams via LLM. Backpressure via `Semaphore(5)`.
- **Spreading Activation** (`activation.py`) — Graph traversal retrieval via recursive CTE. Seeds by cosine similarity, then spreads through weighted edges.
- **Working Memory** (`working_memory.py`) — Five-tier slot system (pinned, sticky, refreshed, sliding, expiring) with token budgeting.
- **Consolidation** (`consolidation.py`) — Background "sleep cycle" with 6 phases: replay, pattern extraction, Hebbian learning, contradiction resolution, pruning/merging, self-model update. Mutex-protected.
- **Neural Router** (`neural_router/`) — Learned ML re-ranker (PyTorch). Trains on retrieval feedback after 200+ labeled observations.
- **Outcome Feedback** (`outcome_feedback.py`) — Post-LLM scoring adjusts engram activation/importance.

**API:** All endpoints at `/api/v1/engrams/` — `POST /ingest`, `POST /context` (main entry point for orchestrator), `POST /activate`, `POST /consolidate`, `GET /stats`, `GET /graph`.

**Orchestrator integration:** `run_agent_turn()` calls `POST /api/v1/engrams/context` for memory, then `POST /mark-used` for feedback. New exchanges are pushed to Redis `engram:ingestion:queue` for async decomposition.

**LLM models default to "auto"** — decomposition, reconstruction, and consolidation models auto-resolve by probing the gateway for available models. Override via `ENGRAM_DECOMPOSITION_MODEL` etc. in `.env`.

### Source Provenance

Every engram links back to a `sources` table tracking where knowledge came from. Sources store metadata (URI, title, author, trust score) and optionally full content (hybrid: DB for small <100KB, filesystem for large at `data/sources/`, URI for re-fetchable). Dedup by content hash and URI.

**Trust defaults by source kind:** chat=0.95, manual_paste=0.90, task_output=0.85, knowledge_crawl=0.70, intel_feed=0.70, pipeline_extraction=0.80, consolidation=0.85, api_response=0.50, screenpipe=0.80.

**API:** `POST /sources` (create/dedup), `GET /sources` (list), `GET /sources/{id}` (detail), `GET /sources/{id}/content` (full content), `DELETE /sources/{id}`, `GET /sources/domain-summary` (knowledge overview), `POST /sources/{id}/redecompose` (re-ingest from stored content).

### Memory Tools

Agents can access memory via tools instead of pre-injected context:

- `what_do_i_know` — lightweight domain overview (~200 tokens)
- `search_memory` — semantic search across engrams
- `recall_topic` — graph traversal from an entity
- `read_source` — full source content retrieval

Controlled by `memory_retrieval_mode` in `.env` (`inject` for legacy 40% pre-injection, `tools` for agent-driven). Default: `inject`.

## Runtime Configuration (Redis)

Several settings are runtime-configurable via Redis (db 1, prefix `nova:config:`), overridable from the Dashboard UI:

| Key | Values | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `inference.backend` | `ollama`, `vllm`, `sglang`, `none` | Which local inference backend the gateway uses |
| `inference.state` | `ready`, `starting`, `error`, `draining` | Whether local inference is accepting requests |
| `inference.url` | URL | Runtime override for the local inference endpoint (replaces legacy `llm.ollama_url`, which is now migrated on gateway startup) |
| `llm.routing_strategy` | `local-first`, `local-only`, `cloud-first`, `cloud-only` | How the gateway routes requests between local and cloud |
| `screenpipe.enabled` | `true`/`false` | Whether the bridge connects to screenpipe |
| `screenpipe.url` | URL | Workstation screenpipe daemon URL (e.g. `http://workstation:3030`) |
| `screenpipe.api_key` | string | Bearer token for screenpipe (write-only after entry in Settings) |
| `capture.paused` | `true`/`false` | Pause capture without disconnecting (sessions still received but discarded) |
| `capture.denylist.apps` | JSON array | App names to exclude from capture |
| `capture.denylist.url_patterns` | JSON array | URL regex patterns to exclude |
| `capture.denylist.window_titles` | JSON array | Window title substrings to exclude |
| `capture.session_max_minutes` | int (5–120) | Max focus session duration before split (default 30) |
| `capture.session_min_seconds` | int (0–300) | Min focus session duration before drop (default 30) |
| `capture.buffer_size` | int (1–100) | Bridge backpressure buffer (default 10) |

**Gotcha:** Stale Redis config values survive container restarts. If inference is broken, check `inference.state` and `inference.backend` in Redis before debugging code. The gateway treats `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=auto`/`host` as aliases for the bundled service URL (`http://ollama:11434`); Redis runtime overrides via `inference.url` win when set.

## Key Configuration

- `.env` — DB password, admin secret, API keys for providers, `DEFAULT_CHAT_MODEL`, `NOVA_WORKSPACE`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `REQUIRE_AUTH`
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` — Set to `auto` (probes host, falls back to Docker), `host` (always use host machine), or explicit URL
- `POSTGRES_DATA_DIR` / `REDIS_DATA_DIR` — Host bind-mount paths for critical data (default: `./data/postgres`, `./data/redis`). Immune to `docker volume prune`.
- `models.yaml` — Ollama models to auto-pull on startup
- Context budgets in orchestrator config: system=10%, tools=15%, memory=40%, history=20%, working=15%
- Voice: `STT_PROVIDER`, `TTS_PROVIDER`, `TTS_VOICE`, `TTS_MODEL` — voice settings (runtime-configurable via dashboard Settings or Redis `nova:config:voice.*`)

## Debugging

Quick diagnostics when something is broken:

```bash
# Container status
docker compose ps

# Service health (all at once)
for p in 8000 8001 8002 8080 8100 8110 8120 8888; do echo -n "localhost:$p → "; curl -sf -m 2 http://localhost:$p/health/ready | python3 -c "import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('status','?'))" 2>/dev/null || echo "DOWN"; done

# Redis config state (stale values are a common root cause)
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -n 1 MGET nova:config:inference.backend nova:config:inference.state nova:config:llm.routing_strategy

# Queue depths
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -n 2 LLEN nova:queue:tasks
docker compose exec redis redis-cli -n 0 LLEN engram:ingestion:queue

# Memory system health
curl -s http://localhost:8002/api/v1/engrams/stats | python3 -m json.tool

# Recent errors across all services
docker compose logs --tail 30 2>&1 | grep -i "error\|exception" | tail -20
```

**When to add a changelog entry:** After shipping a cohesive set of features (not every commit — group related changes into a release entry in `website/src/content/changelog/`).

**When to update landing page:** New differentiating capabilities, major architectural changes, new platform integrations. Update `features.ts` and relevant components.

**Skip** for internal refactors with no user-visible change.

## Design System

Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:

- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review

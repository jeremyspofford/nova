Decisions, dependencies and deviations, newest first within each section.

## Dependencies

Runtime: **none**. The server, runner, markdown renderer and tests use Node 22
built-ins only.

| Dependency | Kind | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `playwright-core` 1.56.1 | dev | Drives Chromium for `npm run shots` (golden screens, keyboard path, budgets); no bundled browser download. |
| `claude` CLI | external | The default `agent_cmd`. Swappable by config; nothing in Nova depends on it. |

## Decisions

**2026-10-21: personal data lives outside the code.** The repo is public
(AGPL). Each person's Nova data is one folder of plain files (`NOVA_HOME`,
default `~/Nova`), seeded from `templates/home/`, and a local git repository
with a commit after every reply. Backup is wherever that folder lives. No
database, no sync service. This also fits a later hub-and-spoke deployment:
the data lives with the runner, and inference spokes only see prompts.
Jeremy asked for a recommendation; this is it, and it is a default path only.

**2026-10-21: a text tool protocol, not a framework.** The model ends a message
with one `<tool_call name="…">{json}</tool_call>` block; Nova runs the tool and
calls the model again with the transcript. This keeps `agent_cmd` swappable
and keeps every approval in Nova's hands. Claude Code is run with its own
tools, hooks, MCP servers and settings disabled.

**2026-10-21: four tools.** `read_file` and `write_file` are confined to the
home folder and cannot touch `sessions/`. `exec` always asks first and starts
in `~/workspace`. `web_fetch` reads http(s) pages as text. There is no
"always allow" in Phase 1.

**2026-10-21: the session log is append-only.** Regenerating a reply starts a
new attempt for the same turn; the view shows the newest attempt and the log
keeps all of them. If the server dies mid-reply, the conversation shows the
reply as interrupted, with Regenerate.

**2026-10-21: the agent's environment is cleaned.** When Nova runs inside a
Claude Code session, that session's memory reached `claude -p` through
environment variables, and Nova repeated things it had no business knowing.
Nova now strips `CLAUDE*MEMORY*`, `CLAUDE*ADDITIONAL_DIRECTORIES*` and
`CLAUDE*CLAUDE_MD*` before spawning the agent. Verified: a canary in
`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` does not reach the model either.

**2026-10-21: the reply ends when the model stops, not when the process
exits.** `claude -p` spends about 2 s on housekeeping after the last token.
Nova finishes at `message_stop` and ends the process, which takes ~2 s off
every step of a tool loop.

**2026-10-21: the scroll budget is judged on Nova's own work per frame.**
The build container has no GPU, so Chromium composites in software and frame
intervals flip between 17 and 33 ms on identical code. The walkthrough traces
the scroll and requires the page's main-thread work to stay under 8 ms a
frame (half the budget); raw intervals are still reported. Older turns use
`content-visibility: auto`, so long threads only lay out what is on screen.

**2026-10-21: no conversation rename or delete in Phase 1.** Restraint: titles
come from the first message, and the files are on disk.

**2026-10-21: localhost only.** The server binds 127.0.0.1 and refuses other
Host headers (DNS rebinding) and cross-site POSTs (a custom header CORS never
grants). Phone access would need `NOVA_HOST` and has no authentication yet;
the server warns when started that way. Not in Phase 1 scope.

## Theme token gaps

None of the three specs defines every token THEMING.md requires. Gaps are
filled from each theme's own palette (mostly `mockups.html`) and marked
`/* derived */` in the token file. Values changed to pass the contract's own
contrast check:

| Theme | Token | Spec | Shipped | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Paper | `--text-2` | `#7A736A` | `#726C63` | 4.38:1 on `--bg`; needs 4.5 |
| Paper | `--text-3` | `#A79D8F` | `#91887B` | 2.5:1 on `--bg`; needs 3 |
| Paper dark | `--accent` | `#C4502B` | `#D9714C` | too dark on evening paper |
| Aurora dark | `--accent-text` | (none) | `#000000` | white on `#7D7AFF` is 3.4:1 |

Contract additions this build needed, proposed for THEMING.md (every theme
defines them, `scripts/check-themes.js` requires them):

- `--font-mono`, `--t-mono`: code, commands, keyboard hints.
- `--t-wordmark`: the sidebar wordmark.
- `--column`: the reading column (680 / 720 / 760 px).
- `--material-blur`: Aurora's frosted surface; 0 elsewhere.
- `--shift`: how far views move when they change; 0 under reduced motion.

Obsidian's spec names differ from the contract (`--panel` is `--surface`,
`--accent-dim` is `--accent-wash`, `--shadow-pop` is `--shadow-2`). Obsidian
is dark in both modes, as its spec defers a light variant.

## Known limits

- Screenshots are rendered on Linux, where New York, Iowan and SF are absent;
  the serif and sans fall back to Liberation/DejaVu. On a Mac, Safari renders
  New York (`ui-serif`) and Chrome renders Iowan Old Style.
- Performance numbers come from the build container, not Jeremy's Mac.
- Margin notes appear when a message matches a dated note. Nothing writes
  dated notes automatically until Phase 2's memory discipline.
